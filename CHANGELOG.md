# Changelog

## Unreleased (0.2.0)

A large correctness + capability release. **No CLI commands, MCP tools, spec
schema fields, or library APIs were removed or renamed** — everything below is
additive or a bug fix. The one compatibility surface to review before
upgrading a CI pipeline is the conformance gate (see *Compatibility &
migration*).

### Conformance gate (the architecture linter)

- The validator is now a **rule registry**: 12 documented rule modules under
  `src/core/rules/`, inspectable via the new **`wairon rules list`** (codes,
  default severities, per-project overrides).
- **New rules:**
  - `MUTUAL_SUBSYSTEM_DEPENDENCY` *(warning)* — two subsystems depending on
    each other must be acknowledged with a `trustedLinks` declaration on
    either side (see below); otherwise the mutual coupling is flagged.
  - `INVALID_TRUSTED_LINK` *(error)* / `UNUSED_TRUSTED_LINK` *(warning)* —
    trusted links must name real peers and correspond to an actual
    cross-subsystem dependency.
  - `GOD_COMPONENT` *(warning)* — `dependsOn` fan-out above 8 suggests a
    split or a pattern facade.
  - `LANGUAGE_FOREIGN_BUILTIN` *(warning)* — with a declared
    `targetLanguage`, signatures using another language family's unambiguous
    builtins (e.g. `Vec`/`usize` in a TypeScript system) are flagged.
    Opt-in: only fires when `targetLanguage` is set.
- **Bug fixes with visible effect:** the unused-detection walk now covers ALL
  interfaces of a component and handles namespaced (subproject) component ids
  — previously invisible unused components/methods may now be reported
  (true positives).

### Spec schema (additive)

- `targetLanguage` on L0 (system default) and L1 (subsystem override).
- `trustedLinks: [{ subsystem, reason }]` on L1 — explicitly sanctioned tight
  couplings ("fast lanes"), turning architectural exceptions into reviewable
  spec.
- Structured method **`params: [{ name, type, description?, optional? }]`**
  on L3 methods — when present they are the AUTHORITATIVE source for
  type-reference validation and the free-form `signature` string is never
  heuristically parsed. Strongly recommended for new specs.

### Spec engine

- **SpecWorkspace**: all spec-tree state (index cache, loader issues) lives on
  per-project-root workspace instances; nested subproject resolution no longer
  mutates a global project root (the historical source of namespacing bugs).
- **Schema-validated writes**: every spec save is Zod-validated first — a
  malformed `sdd_update_spec` delta now fails loudly instead of writing a
  corrupt file.
- **Freshness**: a long-running MCP server now notices external YAML edits
  (mtime-signature cache check, throttled to 2s).
- **Explicit status demotion**: `sdd_update_spec` with an explicit `status`
  can reopen a completed spec; re-adds still cannot silently demote.
- **Endpoint updates**: an explicitly changed endpoint via `sdd_update_spec`
  now wins (previously the stored endpoint silently overwrote it).

### Diagrams & visualization (new)

- **`wairon diagram`** — Mermaid component diagrams (subsystem subgraphs,
  boundary-hop edges, `owns` containment, public-surface marking) and L5
  narrative → sequence diagrams; `--all` writes the full living-doc set.
- **`wairon diagram --canvas`** — interactive single-page HTML canvas
  (Cytoscape.js embedded inline; fully offline): collapsible boundaries with
  aggregated "tube" edges, spec-derived detail panel, search,
  validation-issue overlay, locked blueprint layout with crossing
  minimization, "rearrange" toggle, PNG export.
- **`wairon diagram --drawio` / `--excalidraw`** — editable exports in open
  formats with the same computed layout.
- **Canvas 2.0**: SYW / light themes, redesigned toolbar, view levels
  (System / Components / Full), presentation mode, per-browser layout
  persistence with reset, search dims edges along with nodes, sidebar with
  collapsible sections, hover-highlighting from references, narrative
  flowchart modal (call drill-down with back navigation, PNG export), and an
  Export menu (PNG / draw.io / Excalidraw) that uses the CURRENT — possibly
  rearranged — positions. `--format <fmt>` flag added.
- **Scoped C4-style navigation**: every canvas view renders exactly one
  scope's direct children — System → top-level subsystems → a subsystem's
  children (nested subsystems + components) → a pattern's members,
  infinitely deep by ownership. Double-click (or "Open as view") drills in;
  the breadcrumb navigates back. "Internals" previews each child's own
  children inside its box; "Externals" shows out-of-scope dependencies as
  ghost references (double-click a ghost jumps to it). Layout
  rearrangements persist per view; exports capture the current view.
- **CLI behavior change**: bare `wairon diagram` now writes the interactive
  canvas (the primary format); Mermaid moved behind `--format mermaid` /
  `--subsystem` and writes a file instead of printing to stdout (use a
  `.mmd` `--out` for raw Mermaid).

### Testing & tooling

- End-to-end MCP stdio integration tests (spawn the real server, drive the
  full `sdd_*` authoring pipeline).
- Skills/standards/README/init text updated to the canonical dot-prefixed
  spec layout (`.index.yaml` / `.interface.yaml` / `.implementation.yaml`);
  legacy names still load and `wairon doctor --fix` migrates them.
- Dead `lint` npm script removed (eslint was never configured); vitest 4.

### Compatibility & migration

**Who is affected:** only projects running **`wairon validate --ci`**
(warnings-as-errors) in a pipeline. Plain `wairon validate` is unaffected —
all new rules default to *warning* severity (except `INVALID_TRUSTED_LINK`,
which requires the new field to exist at all).

After upgrading, run `wairon validate` locally and review new warnings:

1. **`MUTUAL_SUBSYSTEM_DEPENDENCY`** — if the mutual coupling is intentional
   (e.g. a latency fast lane bypassing the bus), declare it on either
   subsystem and it becomes sanctioned:

   ```yaml
   trustedLinks:
     - subsystem: runtime-runners
       reason: runtime dispatch latency — bus round-trip too slow
   ```

   Otherwise break one direction (usually via events over the bus).
2. **`GOD_COMPONENT`** — split the workflow or group cohesive collaborators
   behind a Repository/Gateway facade.
3. **New `UNUSED_COMPONENT`/`UNUSED_METHOD` findings** — these were always
   true; the walk previously missed multi-interface components and
   namespaced ids. Wire the narratives or remove the dead surface.
4. Any rule can be tuned per project in `.wai/project.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   rules:
     sddRuleSeverity:
       GOD_COMPONENT: 'off'        # or 'warning' / 'error'
   ```

   Prefer fixing over silencing — the overrides exist for deliberate,
   documented exceptions.

Also note: spec files are canonicalized on their next save (schema defaults
like `trustedLinks: []` are materialized), which produces one-time YAML diff
churn per file. No action needed.
