# wairon — Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-06-14

wairon is an AIDD support tool built around Spec-Driven Development. This roadmap
reflects what is actually shipped in `src/` and what is planned.

---

## Shipped

- **SDD spec tree** — L0 System → L1 Subsystem → L2 Component → L3 Interface →
  L4 Implementation → L5 Narrative, stored under `.wai/specs/`.
- **Architecture-conformance validation** (`wairon validate`) — reference
  integrity, contract↔implementation method symmetry, narrative-call
  resolution, component-stereotype dependency rules, dependency-cycle detection,
  and draft-aware severity.
- **Spec-derived agent topology** (`wairon list` / `generate`) — agents are
  derived from the spec tree (`system-architect`, `<subsystem>-owner`,
  `<component>-implementer`) and written as native subagent files. There is no
  hand-maintained agent registry.
- **Domains** (`wairon domains`) — subsystem-derived domains plus free-standing
  domains declared in `.wai/topology.yaml`, each with a derived owner agent.
- **SDD skills** (`wairon skills`) — installed into each active target tool to
  drive the spec-driven workflow in-session.
- **MCP server** (`wairon mcp`) — topology tools + `sdd_*` tools for authoring
  and validating specs.
- **Shared context** (`.wai/context/`) — project description + auto-generated
  domain map and AI guide.
- **Tooling** — `init`, `status`, self-update with release channels, command
  aliases, multi-target exporters (Claude, Gemini, custom).

## Planned

- **Conformance engine depth** — glob-aware ownership overlap, richer stereotype
  rules, and clearer remediation messages. This is wairon's core differentiator.
- **Derive specs from existing code** — bootstrap a draft spec tree from a repo
  so teams can adopt conformance without greenfield modeling.
- **`wairon generate` cohesion** — optional MCP auto-registration during
  generate (currently explicit via `wairon mcp install`).
- **CI integration** — `wairon validate --ci` in PR checks; conformance diff
  reporting.
- **Org scale** — shared template libraries and cross-project standards.

## Architectural invariants

| Invariant | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| **`.wai/` boundary** | All wairon state lives under `.wai/`; nothing is written elsewhere without explicit opt-in. |
| **No hidden server** | Everything runs on-demand; the MCP server is a subprocess, not a daemon. |
| **No database** | All state is human-readable YAML/JSON. |
| **Works offline** | No network requirement; update checks are opt-in. |
| **Specs are the source of truth** | Agents and conformance are derived from `.wai/specs/`; generated files are outputs. |
| **wairon equips, not orchestrates** | wairon does not run AI sessions — it produces subagents, skills, and MCP tools the host tool consumes. |

---

## History note

Earlier drafts explored a local AI orchestration hub (session spawning,
delegation, multi-model pipelines, git worktrees). That direction was retired in
favour of equipping the host AI tool's own native subagent mechanism. The
orchestration code has been removed; this roadmap supersedes those plans.
